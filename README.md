# NetPractice - 42 Amman Networking Project

A project-based learning experience in computer networking fundamentals through practical network configuration challenges.

## Project Overview
NetPractice is a series of 10 progressively challenging networking exercises where I configured simulated networks to establish proper communication between devices. Each level presented a unique network topology with specific connectivity requirements that needed to be solved through correct IP addressing and network configuration.

## Key Features
- 10 levels of increasing complexity
- Real-world networking scenarios
- Web-based interface for configuration
- Immediate feedback system
- Configuration file export capability

## What I Learned ðŸ§ 

### TCP/IP Addressing Fundamentals
- Mastered IPv4 address structure and classes
- Practiced subnet mask calculation and CIDR notation
- Implemented proper gateway configuration
- Understood network vs host address spaces

### Subnetting Techniques
- Calculated optimal subnet sizes for different network segments
- Determined valid host ranges within subnets
- Avoided IP address conflicts through proper allocation
- Implemented efficient IP space management

### Routing Concepts
- Configured static routes between multiple subnets
- Established communication across routers
- Implemented default gateway configurations
- Understood packet flow between network segments

### DHCP Principles
- Identified appropriate DHCP server placement
- Configured IP address distribution ranges
- Set up reservation ranges for specific devices

### Network Segmentation
- Created VLAN-like separated networks
- Implemented communication between segments
- Configured intermediate routing devices
- Optimized network traffic flow

### Troubleshooting Skills
- Analyzed connectivity issues through diagnostic logs
- Debugged IP configuration errors
- Fixed routing table misconfigurations
- Resolved subnet masking errors

## How to Use
